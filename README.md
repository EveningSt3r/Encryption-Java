# Encryption-Java
VERY simple java program to take a String and shift all characters, encrypting it. 
The program runs entirely from main, and the actual encryption is very simple. Just a shift of each character in a converted String.
The interface is designed to loop, which took a lot more work than it should have. Enjoy.
